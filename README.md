# Luxuary Brand upgrade website


My project name is Webpage Upgrade. I have searched multiple platforms and different project to check and choose the one that’s right for me. 
In the end i chose to do this project called the Webpage Upgrade of my own. 
Basically, while doing this project i chose to go with doing fashion brand for a luxurious brand but most of the brand’s website are two sides of the pole they are either extremely good or extremely bad. 
So i chose a luxury brand with a band (un user friendly) website where it is hard to navigate and locate what is happening. i took some ideas form several websites platform on how they are being navigated and more and used my own imagination to also create this website.
I have made my website user friendly so that when a person with little knowledge or wants an easier version for shopping they can access it through my website

 
## Design Process
 
My websites are mainly for customers or regular people who want to take a look at the YSl (my website) and not have a difficult time accessing/navigating it and be more eager to buy a lot of the YSl stuffs. This will ensure that the person will take a few moments to look through the website rather that clicking it and exiting the website withing few minutes because it is inaccessible (original YSl website)

-	As a user i want them to use the individual page on which they are interested and fill in the survey 
-	As the websit4e creator i want to see the survey forms that send the feedback to see that number 1 the survey works number 2 that the website was user friendly.

## Features

I will be explaining my website in simple sentence here:

### Existing Features

- Home (index.html) - Allows user to see the latest news in slide show and they can choose where they want to go
- Cosmetic/Fragrance/Skin Care/Clothing/Accessories/Jewellery - All these pages show the price and the cost of them 
- About Us - This page talks about the history of YSL and more about YSL.
- Contact Us - This page shows us the survey they need to do and how they felt about them  

For now, since they was not enough time i was unable to complete the login / register page but if i have a few days or so i might be able to finish that too.


### Features Left to Implement

- Login/Register page

## Testing

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

2. For all the individual pages u can chose what you want to buy and you can see the total prize in the cart and what they chose

Around 65% of my websites can be used in phone mode but due to some of the size not being mentioned and me not knowning how to resize them i was only able to resize some of the parts for the website that works for both desktop and mobile

Ywhile doing this project they were some part where for the javascript i was unable to get the answer and the output was wrong but it worked fine after several tries
